How to Install Python:
----------------------
1. Visit the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download the latest version of Python for your operating system
   (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Run the installer and follow the installation wizard.
   - On Windows, make sure to check the box that says
     "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
4. Verify the installation by opening a command prompt or terminal
   and typing: python --version

Setting Up Your Development Environment:
----------------------------------------
1. Choose and install a code editor or IDE. Some popular options are:
   - Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - PyCharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
   - Sublime Text (https://www.sublimetext.com/)

2. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt
   - Navigate to your project directory
   - Run: python -m venv myenv
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
     - On macOS/Linux: source myenv/bin/activate

3. Install additional packages as needed using pip:
   pip install package_name

You're now ready to start coding in Python!

Throughout this course, we'll be using this environment to write,
run, and debug Python code. Make sure to keep your Python installation
and packages up to date for the best experience.

Let's begin our journey into the world of Python programming!
